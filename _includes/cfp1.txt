=====================================

Computer Science Logic (CSL) is the annual conference of the European
Association for Computer Science Logic (EACSL),
see https://www.eacsl.org/.

It is an interdisciplinary conference, spanning across both basic and
application oriented research in mathematical logic and computer
science.

CSL 2026 is the 34th edition of the conference and will be held in Paris on
the 23-28 February 2026 and is organised by the Logic and Computation
team of the LIPN of Sorbonne Paris Nord University.

Topics:
--------------
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
- automated deduction and interactive theorem proving
- concurrency and distributed computation
- constructive mathematics and type theory
- equational logic and term rewriting
- automata and games, game semantics
- formal methods
- model checking
- decision procedures
- modal and temporal logic
- description logics
- logical aspects of computational complexity
- logical aspects of AI
- finite model theory
- computability
- computational proof theory
- logic programming and constraints
- lambda calculus and combinatory logic
- domain theory
- categorical logic and topological semantics
- database theory
- specification, extraction and transformation of programs
- logical aspects of quantum computing
- logical foundations of programming paradigms
- verification and program analysis
- linear logic
- higher-order logic
- knowledge representation and reasoning
- nonmonotonic reasoning

Submission:
--------------
Submitted papers must be in English and must provide sufficient detail
to allow the Programme Committee to assess the merits of the paper.
Full proofs may appear in a clearly marked technical appendix which
will be read at the reviewers' discretion. Authors are strongly
encouraged to include a well written introduction which is directed at
all members of the PC.

The paper should be submitted via Easychair:
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=csl2026 (the link will be
opened in early June)

The CSL 2026 conference proceedings will be published in the Leibniz
International Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs), see
https://drops.dagstuhl.de/entities/series/LIPIcs.

Authors are invited to submit contributed papers of no more than
15 pages in LIPIcs style (not including appendices or references),
see https://submission.dagstuhl.de/series/details/LIPIcs#author,
presenting unpublished work fitting the scope of the
conference. Papers may not be submitted concurrently to another
conference with refereed proceedings. The PC chairs should be
informed of closely related work submitted to a conference or a
journal.

Papers authored or co-authored by members of the PC (but not PC
chairs) are allowed.

The submissions are double-blind:
- Authors are not allowed to put their name on the paper, and they
   should avoid revealing their identities in text (references to previous
   or related work should be in third-person).
- Authors are allowed (and even encouraged) to disseminate the work
   on public repositories (e.g. on arXiv or their websites).

At least one of the authors of each accepted paper is expected to
register for the conference in order to present their paper.

Important dates:
--------------
All deadlines are midnight anywhere-on-earth (AoE);
late submissions will not be considered.
